**ABANDONED** in favor of [cli-view](https://github.com/azimut/cli-view) which would hopefully have a TUI soon...

A simple cli view of some sites. Used mainly with newsboat.

｜For sequence operations there's the [extensible
｜sequences](https://shinmera.github.io/trivial-extensible-sequences) protocol. It's
｜currently supported by SBCL and ABCL. Get your implementation of choice to support
｜it, too!

｜The package should have nicknames `SLOW-COMMON-LISP` and `SLOW-CL`.

   ｜That was also my initial reaction, but then I remembered that the author also
   ｜tries to make  dispatch faster: [https://github.com/alex-gutev/static
   ｜dispatch](https://github.com/alex-gutev/static-dispatch)
   ｜
   ｜He mentions that on the bottom of the generic-cl github page.
   ｜
   ｜The interesting question is, what it means in real life for actual software:
   ｜performance, robustness, ...
   ｜
   ｜So, I think the author is not naive about this and it's an interesting
   ｜experiment. Languages which tried to make multiple dispatch faster were/are:
   ｜commercial CL vendors, Dylan, earlier CLOS related research and lately the Julia
   ｜language implementation.

      ｜I don’t think there was any naivety on the author’s part. I haven’t
      ｜been able to use things like inlined-generic-functions successfully in Real
      ｜Code (TM).

** (to be) Supported sites
*** Reddit
   New ui is awful, mainly due not being able to see all comments on a single page, one needs to be constantly clicking to get more comments.
   Old reddit has that but unlike new reddit, that looks ok-ish, it looks awful on cli browser like w3m.
*** vi-chan
   Boards are fine but there is not native threaded view of posts so dialogue is confusing. Also it would be nice to highlight new posts since last seen.
