* cliview
A cli view of some sites. Used mainly with newsboat.
** Reddit
   New ui is awful, mainly due not being able to see all comments on a single page, one needs to be constantly clicking to get more comments.
   Old reddit has that but unlike new reddit, that looks ok-ish, it looks awful on cli browser like w3m.
** -chan
   Boards are fine but there is not native threaded view of posts so dialogue is confusing. Also it would be nice to highlight new posts since last seen.
