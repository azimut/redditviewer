# Guide to World Domination

The first thing to remember about world domination is that everyone _hates_
the dominator, but loves this liberator. You are a **liberator**.

Once you realise that you're a ***liberator*** of the people, everything
else is easy. They will [love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love) you for
your firm hand.

## The code

This system is based on a simple computer algorithm:

    FLOATING POINT ALGOL TEST'
    BEGIN REAL A,B,C,D'

    READ D'

    FOR A:= 0.0 STEP D UNTIL 6.3 DO
    BEGIN
      PRINT PUNCH(3),££L??'
      B := SIN(A)'
      C := COS(A)'
      PRINT PUNCH(3),SAMELINE,ALIGNED(1,6),A,B,C'
    END'
    END'
